# hello-world
Hello GitHub!

I studied OO in the Open University. Java was used to teach OO consepts. Although I thoroughly enjoyed creating and was contemplating of changing my career to the realm of software development, my live had diferent priorities in store for me.

Now that I've reached the top career in the previous job, my urge is stronger that ever to brush up on my Java skills. Get uptodate with technologies etc.
And finally immerse myself into the domain of software development.

GitHub seems like a fantastic platform to share the expertise and showcase you knowledge and skills.
